# Purpose: 

I have witnessed hundreds of students ask where to begin with **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. This made me realise the need for and overload of information provided on **YouTube**, which may make beginners feel confused and demotivated. 

This repository will contain codes on various **Data Science** problems not limited to **Classification**, **Visualisation**, **Natural Language Processing** but also **Fine Tuning of LLMs** and **OpenCV**

# Goal:

I aim to share code which would not only be intuitive but also make my own foundations and concepts even more straightforward.
